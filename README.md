## Quantum Playground

Quantum Playground is an interactive Python application for exploring the stationary Schr√∂dinger equation in one and two dimensions. It allows users to study quantum systems under a variety of potentials, including harmonic oscillators, infinite square wells, and double wells, as well as user-defined custom potentials.

This project was developed as a self-study tool based on Griffiths' "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics."

It allows you to **compute eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and probability densities**, and visualise quantum systems interactively.

## Features

The application is organised into two main modes, each with 1D and 2D capabilities:

### Stationary States
- Solves the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for bound states.
- Calculates and visualises energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ($œà_n(x)$).
- Plots the probability densities ($|\psi_n(x)|^2$) for each state.
- Includes a library of standard potentials:
  - Infinite Square Well (Particle in a Box)
  - Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
  - Double Well Potential
  - Finite Square Well

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Time Evolution
- Solves the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation to simulate the dynamics of a wave packet.
- Animates the probability density ($|\psi(x,y,t)|^2$) over time in 1D and 2D.
- **Physics Visualised**:
  - **Quantum Tunneling**: A wave packet scattering off a potential barrier.
  - **Wave Packet Oscillation**: A particle moving in a 2D harmonic potential.
  - **Momentum Space**: Simultaneously visualises the wave function's evolution in momentum space ($|\phi(p,t)|^2$).
- **Scattering Analysis**:
  - Automatically calculates the **Reflection (R)** and **Transmission (T)** coefficients after a 1D scattering simulation, providing a quantitative link to scattering theory.


## üìö Background

The project numerically solves the two fundamental forms of the Schr√∂dinger equation.

The **time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation** is treated as a matrix eigenvalue problem to find stationary states:
```math
\left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right] \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
```
The **time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation** is solved as an initial value problem using the Crank-Nicolson method to simulate dynamics:

```math
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \right] \Psi(x,t)
```
**Installation**

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

</pre>```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mezzirak/quantum-playground.git
cd quantum_playground```</pre>

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

</pre>```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows ```</pre>

3. Install dependincies:
   
</pre>```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```</pre>

If requirements.txt is not present, install directly:

</pre>```pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib plotly scipy```</pre>

**Usage**

Run the application:

</pre>```streamlit run app.py```</pre>

- Select 1D or 2D in the sidebar
- Pick a predefined protential or use a custome potential
- Adjust the number or eigenstates, grid points and potential parameters
- Visualise eigenstates and probability densities interactively
