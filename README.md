## Quantum Playground

Quantum Playground is an interactive Python application for exploring the stationary Schr√∂dinger equation in one and two dimensions. It allows users to study quantum systems under a variety of potentials, including harmonic oscillators, infinite square wells, and double wells, as well as user-defined custom potentials.

This project was developed as a self-study tool based on Griffiths' "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics."

It allows you to **compute eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and probability densities**, and visualise quantum systems interactively.

## Features

The application is organised into two main modes, each with 1D and 2D capabilities:

### Stationary States
- Solves the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for bound states in 1D and 2D.
- **1D**: Calculates and visualises energy eigenvalues, eigenfunctions ($œà_n(x)$), and probability densities ($|\psi_n(x)|^2$).
- **2D**: Displays interactive 3D surface plots of the probability densities ($|\psi_n(x,y)|^2$) using Plotly.
- **Analysis**: Includes a tool to numerically verify the orthogonality of eigenstates.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Time Evolution
- Solves the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation to simulate the dynamics of a wave packet in 1D and 2D.
- **Physics Visualised**:
  - **Quantum Tunnelling**: A 1D wave packet scattering off a potential barrier.
  - **Momentum Space**: Simultaneously visualises the wave function's evolution in momentum space ($|\phi(p,t)|^2$).
  - **Ehrenfest's Theorem**: Compares the quantum expectation value `<x>` to the trajectory of a classical particle, demonstrating the correspondence principle.
- **Analysis Tools**:
  - **Scattering Analysis**: Calculates the Reflection (R) and Transmission (T) coefficients from 1D scattering simulations.
  - **GIF Export**: Allows the user to download 1D and 2D animations as GIF files for easy sharing.


## üìö Background

The project numerically solves the two fundamental forms of the Schr√∂dinger equation.

The **time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation** is treated as a matrix eigenvalue problem to find stationary states:
```math
\left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right] \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
```
The **time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation** is solved as an initial value problem using the Crank-Nicolson method to simulate dynamics:

```math
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \right] \Psi(x,t)
```
